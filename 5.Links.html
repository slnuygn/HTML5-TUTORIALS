    <p>learn to give external links by using 'a' tag</p>

    <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" title="Google Link">Go to Google</a>

    <p>dont forget to add the adress you want to go to, write it in the first a tag as href="http://www.google.com"</p>

    <p>if we want the link to open the website in a new tab and not our existing one, also add target="_blank" </p>

    <p>if you want to add a title, also add title="Google Link" so when you get your mouse on it and not click,
        the title is going to pop up</p>

    <p>we can also travel to other pages that we have created in this folder</p>

    <a href="3.Styling.html" target="_blank">Styling Document</a>
    <a href="4.Formatting.html" target="_blank">Formatting Document</a>

    <p>the links you clicked before will be shown as purple</p>
